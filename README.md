**Welcome Viewer, this is Jake's Read Me file for the odin-recipes assignment**

This file is a demonstration of HTML document formatting and structuring, with a focus on building lists, adding images, and linking page content.

Update (9/17/2024): The file is also used to practice CSS concepts, particularly using external css to control the formatting and display of the recipes.
